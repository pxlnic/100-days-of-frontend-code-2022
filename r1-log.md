## Log

### R1D1 
Initialized Vue "todo app" and started to gather requirements and plan the application out. Utilized the [Vue.js docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html#with-build-tools) to re-familiarize myself with the library.

### R1D0
Created repository and laid out inital plan, which is to create a robust "todo app" with four different frontend techs (vue, svelte, solid, and alpine)
