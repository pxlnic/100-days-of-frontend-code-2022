# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: February 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the Vue Todos App project
- Got most requirements gathered and started the Vue 3 project
    - Using Vue and TailwindCSS primarily
- Sketched general design to use
- Cleaned up the boilerplate/demo code and got the base structure down
- Noted most components that will be needed (still trying to identify some.)

**Thoughts:** A productive day and trying to take a measured approach to the apps design and evelopment. Still working on requirements and end design.

**Link to work:** In the 'vue-js-todo-app' folder

## Day 0: February 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created repository and planning my learning and projects out for the next 100 days.
- I will start by building a complete "to do" application with the four frontends I am going to learn.
- I am going to start with brushing up on Vue since I am already familiar with it.
- I will move on to Svelte after, then Solid JS, and lastly Alpine JS.
- From there I will build a different application with each.
- My goal is to start this tomorrow (2/14/2022)

**Thoughts:** I want to have some versatility when it comes to building web apps. I don't want to pigeonhole myself with only Vue. I don't know that I want to go down the React or Angular hold though.

**Link to work:** None currently.
